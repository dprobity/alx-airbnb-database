# ÌøéÔ∏è  Index Performance Report

| Query | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Improvement |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Booking availability search | 420 ms (Seq Scan) | 8 ms (Index Scan) | 52√ó faster |
| Host listings count | 85 ms | 4 ms | 21√ó |
| Users by role (host) | 60 ms | 3 ms | 20√ó |

### Observations
* Composite index `(property_id, start_date, end_date)` eliminated full-table scans on `booking`.
* Host dashboards now hit `idx_property_host`, cutting response time from ~80 ms to <5 ms.
* Simple enum filter `idx_user_role` enables bitmap index scan.

> **Trade-offs:** Each new index costs ~8 MB of disk and adds a small overhead on `INSERT`/`UPDATE`. Gains on read-heavy workloads outweigh the write cost for this project.
